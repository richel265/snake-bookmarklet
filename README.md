# Snake Bookmarklet

**Warning!** This is a fork. You can find the original repo at **[epidemian/snake](https://github.com/epidemian/snake)**

This fork contains bookmarklets and has had the code adapted so that you can add to your bookmark bar to be able to play this game on every website.
This version also shows the snake game in the tab title now, using my <snake.combo.js> file..

Play the classic snake game on a URL or on the titlebar!

<https://demian.ferrei.ro/snake>

This is how the game should look:

Note that the game might be unplayable on some browsers for different reasons, like the browser not showing the full URL, or not allowing it to change so frequently, or escaping the Braille characters used to display the game.

Although this game is kind of a joke, bug reports, ideas and pull requests are always [welcome](https://github.com/richel265/snake-bookmarklet/pulls)!
